for South Sudan's presence.
- Expand t/test.t to check sub-country names near the end of the list.

[V 1.02]
Date=2011-08-30T10:49:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Add South Sudan.
- Move data/countries.csv and data/sub_countries.csv into the source code of Locale::Country::SubCountry::Base,
since trying to keep the data in SQLite lead to an endless series of test failure reports.
This involved many patches, including deletion of modules and scripts to do with a db-style implementation.
- Rename sub init() to sub _init() in each module, to emphasize it's not for general consumption.
- Add <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /> to the web page templates, so that
non-English subcountry names display properly in the output of scripts/export.sub.countries.as.html.pl.
